Neuronics has developed a community model of a robotic arm called IPR. The model we specifically use is "IprHd6ms180.proto".
This folder contains:
- Webot world file
- Controller file that inlcudes the IPR class
- Makefile that points to IPR library for compilation
  - Note: may need to change path name for personal location
