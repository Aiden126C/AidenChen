# EC601_Team7th_CareBotics

__Project Definition:__ The overall goal of our project is to create a working robotic arm in simulation that can assist those in wheelchairs and those with limited upper-body mobility. The primary objective would be the full simulation of the arm in software, and then there are two secondary objectives that are time permitting. The first would be to create a modular user-controller interface that will allow plug-and-play controllers; such as a joystick, eye-tracking, and/or voice-controlled. The second would be to 3D print a single joint and use a servo motor to operate it as a prototype.


__User Stories:__ 
* As a user, 
  * I want to have at least 6 degrees of freedom.
  * I want the arm to be durable in my day-to-day life
  * I want the arm to be affordable
  * I want the arm to have a long battery life
* As someone in a wheelchair, 
  * I want to hold open doors
  * I want to have extended reach
  * I want to be able to grab things
* As someone with limited upper body mobility,
  * I want to be able to grab, hold, and manipulate objects
  * I want to be able to drink independently
  * I want to be able to eat independently
  * I want to be able to take medication
  * I want to press elevator buttons
  * I want to turn on/off light switches
  * I want to manage personal care (brush hair, scratch an itch, etc.)
* As someone with limited upper body strength,
  * I want to grip and hold things securely
